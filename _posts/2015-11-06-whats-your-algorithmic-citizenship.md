All of these stories are really interesting, and I highly recommend all of them, but this one stuck out to me. `.io` is an extremely popular domain name, and while I had heard about the controversy surrounding the use of the `.ly` TLD, there wasn't any similar outrage abou the rise of `.io`. Many of the interesting TLDs are tied to countries, and `.io` is tied to the British Indian Ocean Territories, a collection of islands that were straight up stolen from the people who lived there so Great Britain and the United States could use them for a military base.
