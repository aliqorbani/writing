Quick Vue tip: lifecycle methods `update` & `beforeUpdate` will not be called if the props that changed for a component aren't being used to render. In my case, I was using a prop not used by the render method to trigger some side effect, and couldn't get the callback to trigger the side effect. Use `this.$watch` to watch prop changes unrelated to a Vue component's rendering.
