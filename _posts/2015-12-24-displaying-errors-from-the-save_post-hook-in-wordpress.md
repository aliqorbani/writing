If you work in WordPress, you may have run into difficulties displaying errors that may occur on the `save_post` hook. Since WordPress redirects before loading the post edit page, you don't have access to anything done on that hook hook when the post edit page loads. I detail 3 possible solutions to in this article for Sitepoint.
