# Guess Who Talks About Abortion On Cable News? (Hint: Not Experts) #

Building off a bit of [yesterday's post on the lack of diversity within the newsroom](http://www.ibtimes.com/fighting-words/lack-diversity-newsroom-bad-society-1340723 "The Lack Of Diversity In The Newsroom Is Bad For Society"), it appears cable news' diversity problem extends beyond merely the people in the newsroom, but the people who appear as guests as well. [Media Matters reports](http://mediamatters.org/research/2013/07/10/on-cable-news-womens-health-experts-noticeably/194818) that, of the 92 guests that discussed Texas' abortion bill on cable news (the one [Wendy Davis filibustered](http://www.ibtimes.com/sen-wendy-davis-filibuster-texas-abortion-bill-defeat-tuesday-deadline-looms-1322053 "Sen. Wendy Davis To Filibuster Texas Abortion Bill To Defeat As Tuesday Deadline Looms")), only *four of them* were women's health experts. Unsurprisingly, Fox News hosted none, "while CNN and MSNBC hosted two and three, respectively."

Interestingly, Chloe of Feministing is [fairly measured in her response](http://feministing.com/2013/07/11/coverage-of-reproductive-rights-features-almost-no-reproductive-health-experts/ "Coverage of reproductive rights features almost no reproductive health experts"), pointing out that it is a political debate, and having politicians on a news program to discuss the issue is fair.  Fair enough, but political commenters will *always* be involved in conversations about lawmaking, so it seems strange to begin with a defense of that practice.  She does summarize it this way:

> But based on these graphs, it looks like coverage of these issues is falling into the very same trap as the lawmakers themselves: a whole bunch of people who aren’t doctors sitting around talking about reproductive health.

This pretty much sums up my feelings on the issue, and the media does a poor job of highlighting the opinions of those with actual background on the issue, favoring opinionated and bombastic personalities for good television over experts with information.  ThinkProgress [also noted](http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/07/11/2283311/womens-health-experts-texas-cable/ "Women’s Health Experts Virtually Absent From Cable News Coverage Of Texas Abortion Bill") that previous coverage of birth control on cable news [highlighted male voices over female voices at a 2:1 margin](http://thinkprogress.org/media/2012/02/10/423211/cable-report-birth-control-men-women/ "REPORT: By A Nearly 2 To 1 Margin, Cable Networks Call On Men Over Women To Comment On Birth Control"). At least that was a bit more evenly balanced, but still, we're not seeing a lot of alternative perspectives among cable's guests.
