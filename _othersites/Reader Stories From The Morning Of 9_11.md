> My Grandmother handed me the phone at like 7:30AM. I was sleeping but heard my best friend yelling on the other end of the phone, "Oh my God, girl!! Turn on the TV!!" Sleepily, I got the remote, and turned on the little TV in my room. I quickly sprung out of bed and felt wide awake as my eyes widened, my voice rose and the words of shock and horror flowed through the phone. I cried with my friend on the phone and then excused myself to call my aunt and cousin who lived in the city. We couldn't get through because the lines were all down. I was trying to tell my dying Grandfather what was happening, but I think it was too confusing for him to understand at that time. He died on September 25th. That was a very difficult time in my life indeed. It was also my first semester in college. I did not know anyone who died in the tragedy, but the fear of terrorism was so widespread, it was impossible to avoid.

**Marc Winsland**

> I was just five years old and at school (in Britain) when the planes hit, so I was understandably unaware of what was happening, but, thinking back (it's the type of day anybody would find difficult to forget), I recall being told about it by our teacher after much of the staff became quiet and disconcerted. We were scared, likely wondering if such a thing might happen to our school too. 

> My grandmother was in a bar which was busy at the time, but the whole place went eerily silent as everybody turned to look at the news. Everybody was utterly nonplussed, speechless, shocked. It was an assault on the world which will never be forgotten - nor should it be. I just find it incredible that much of the world knew of the attack before the President of the United States knew; such is the speed of modern media.

**Brenda Cooper Osher**

> I was in administration in a nursing home. I heard the residents crying and ran to a room to see a tower in flames. The second tower was struck and we all stood in stunned silence. Residents began shouting that we were being attacked from the skies as others were convinced that planes were falling a result of the Rapture. All began praying. 

> My son was a lawyer in NYC. No cell service or land lines to reach him. Many worried hours followed. I found out later he had gone to LA with his fiancÃ©e to get their marriage license and were safe. He lost so many friends and colleagues that day.

**Jessica Marie:**

> I was a new mom. My daughter was 11 days old. Her and I woke up and we went to sit on the couch while I was breastfeeding her. I turned on the news and watched as a second plane hit. I was mortified, scared... I called her dad at work and told him to come home because I was freaking out. I told him that if I knew our world is going to come to this I wouldn't have had our daughter. She just turned 12 and is now asking me why there is war all the time, and unfortunately these days I don't have an answer for her. My answer is our government is twisted and corrupt and we don't know who to trust, that we are hoping for her generation will get those corrupted government officials out all of them every last single one and hopefully her generation can save us. I tell her we need a revolution!!

**Kelsey Gates**

> Sheldon Intermediate in Houston, Texas. Ms. Smith's 5th grade classroom. A few hours went by and hundreds of kids were picked up from our school that day. During lunch, the library was crammed full of teachers watching the news. It wasn't until after lunch that they allowed students to watch the news ourselves. Ms. Smith was the first adult that I saw react to those events. I'll always remember the face of horror she made watching the television and the tears that quickly followed.

**Erik Alvarado**

> I was a sophomore in high school, in the counselors office because I wanted to switch to a higher math class. The TV in the room was on CNN when they switched to the coverage. I saw the second plane hit live. I didn't leave the office for about 3 hours that morning. Everyone stopped working to witness the tragedy. We all knew that the world we lived in before would never be the same.

**Barbara Smith**

> I was headed to work in Chattanooga, TN. I stopped to get a drink downstairs at Warehouse Row. The television was on and every person was standing in shock watching. We stood there watching the events. I have never felt a heavier pain of so many lives touch my heart. I could feel a mountain of pain in my chest. I ran up to my store put a note on the door: "closed for prayer, go pray for our country!"

**Lina Cellucci**

> I was working at the largest airport in Canada. Our CEO was American, and we were watching it unfold in our executive office with shock and horror. We were preparing for the worst as we did not know who or what the targets were. Needless to say, we saw aircraft from all over the world landing at the airport that we have never seen before. It was a day no one will ever forget.
