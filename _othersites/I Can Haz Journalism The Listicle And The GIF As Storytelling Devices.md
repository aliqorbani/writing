# I Can Haz Journalism: The Listicle (And The GIF) As Storytelling Devices #

Can listicles function as a legitimate journalistic form?

I felt forced to reconsider the question after [this tweet](https://twitter.com/joelcifer/status/355352410228666368) from Joel Cifer:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>A US Senator actually wrote an op-ed listicle for <a href="https://twitter.com/BuzzFeed">@Buzzfeed</a> on student loan rates <a href="http://t.co/H7y0R62p1y">http://t.co/H7y0R62p1y</a> I love BF but I feel insulted</p>&mdash; Joel Pavelski (@joelcifer) <a href="https://twitter.com/joelcifer/statuses/355352410228666368">July 11, 2013</a></blockquote>

[I disagreed with him](https://twitter.com/JamesDiGioia/status/355352561533988867); I liked the listicle format for [this particular op-ed](http://www.buzzfeed.com/senatorblumenthal/11-reasons-why-congress-needs-to-fix-student-loan-c703 "11 Reasons Why Congress Needs To Fix Student Loan Rates Now"). While there are some problems with it, as it doesn't really get into a whole lot of depth on the issue, I think it works quite well for an opinion piece; it quickly conveys some of the facts and responses to student loan rates in a fairly easy-to-consume format while not being all that different from a standard op-ed.

So why aren't we using this as a legitimate way of telling stories?

At this point, I was going to reference this Buzzfeed piece, [Behold The Horrifying Way Maraschino Cherries Are Made](http://www.buzzfeed.com/jessicamisener/behold-the-horrifying-way-maraschino-cherries-are-made "Behold The Horrifying Way Maraschino Cherries Are Made"), but it is no longer in its original form. Where the video currently is used to be a series of GIFs, walking through the process of making the cherries with amusing explanatory captions to go along with them. I assume they've been removed for copyright infringement.

This is a form of story telling. I imagine a written piece on the subject would not have anywhere near the impact the listicle (or video) has. You can organize these lists into a story, the same way you can organize words. No one denies that a video can tell a story, so it seems like, in the Internet age, we shouldn't be shying away from GIFs as a storytelling device.

But it appears the listicle, even within Buzzfeed itself, suffers from a bit of a branding problem. I sifted through Buzzfeed's Politics section to see if I could find another example of a listicle providing useful information and context on a current event, and I was surprised to only find "[These Republicans Who Want To Limit Food Stamps Represent A Lot Of Food Stamp Recipients](http://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/these-republicans-who-want-to-limit-food-stamps-represent-a "These Republicans Who Want To Limit Food Stamps Represent A Lot Of Food Stamp Recipients")," which is basically just a chart.

The problem is the listicle is often conflated with pieces like "[21 Pictures That Will Restore Your Faith In Humanity](http://www.buzzfeed.com/expresident/pictures-that-will-restore-your-faith-in-humanity "21 Pictures That Will Restore Your Faith In Humanity")" and [lists of cat gifs](http://www.buzzfeed.com/animals "Buzzfeed Animals"). But as Buzzfeed expands its editorial vision into serious news and information, I find it surprising its use isn't more prevalent.

The flip side to this is in trying to force a story into a listicle format. My colleague Ryan Neal [was bothered by Buzzfeed's](http://www.ibtimes.com/fighting-words/buzzfeed-list-insults-debases-egyptian-revolution-1339239 "BuzzFeed List Insults And Debases The Egyptian Revolution") use of the format for [explaining the Egyptian revolution in Jurrasic Park GIFs](http://www.buzzfeed.com/bennyjohnson/the-story-of-egypts-revolution-in-jurassic-park-gifs "The Story Of Egyptâ€™s Revolution In "Jurassic Park" Gifs"). Ryan raises some great points; besides the fact that the analogies are bad and inconsistent, it's insulting to the significance of the event to reduce it to its similarities to a movie. But I do think Buzzfeed wants to do serious journalism, and some of its long-form writing has been quite good.

I'm curious to see if Buzzfeed can merge the serious with the silly to provide information and context to those who want it.
