# Collected Writings

This git repo maintains a collection of my writings and works-in-progress published both on my website at [JamesDiGioia.com][home] as well as elsewhere. If you find errors or typos, or want to expand on particular points and ideas, feel free to fork and open a pull request.

The export from my website is handled by [WordPress <--> Github Sync][wpghs] and any changes made on GitHub will be reflected there.
