Riding home on the train, I no longer have to check the train stations to figure out which stop I'm coming up to or where I am. You can tell by the landscape; North Jersey is a burnt out shell of a place, especially along the train tracks, where you see all sorts of rubbish and trash left scattered across the road, discarded as waste much like the land itself. As you begin to get more into Central Jersey, that lovely area that the North and South pretend don't exist (and I don't kid; I've participated in quite a few arguments with people who claimed it was only North and South), the landscape changes, from the industrial wasteland and its factories and empty warehouses to a stifled, yet greener community, an area trying very desperately to appear to still be tending the land, but if you look hard enough, you'll realize very quickly that its "earthly" beauty is still very much suppressed by humanity's desire to keep it all in order. Neatly manicured lawns and houses with pools in their backyards, rows after rows of them line the edges of the train tracks as I'm whisked on by. I never do get to South Jersey; I don't live there, don't know anyone there, and don't find reason to visit either. I've always characterized it as farms, the "Hicksville" of New Jersey, rounding out the "evil axis" of New Jersey's types. Clearly, I don't actually believe it's entirely the way I picture it in my mind, but it serves its purpose beautifully: with it, I can characterize New Jersey as the harborer of the tripartite of America's social sickness: the poor, urban wasteland, the pretentious, wealthy, and perpetually out-of-touch suburbia, and the ignorant, uncultured, rural backwoods.
