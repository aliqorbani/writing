# Oh, how we misunderstand our digital world

I work in social media, so I work hard at making sure I'm paying attention to what the theorizers are saying, the latest in marketing, as well as just using these tools myself.[^1] Because of how much information is out there, as well as how many people are currently studying this issue, I'm often struck by how often people misunderstand how these networks function for individuals in their day-to-day lives.

The latest example is the [\#SamaritansRadar][1]. Here's how it work: You sign up with your Twitter account through a mobile app, and the app scans the people you follow for signs of depression and suicidal tendencies. It then alerts you that someone you follow may be in distress, giving you an opportunity to help out in someone's moment of need. Sounds good, right?

The article explains some of the issues surrounding consent, surveillance, and the problem with imposing these things upon those who could be suffering from mental health issues. The thing that struck me, though, was Samaritan's Jenn Russell's reaction, recorded as a video response:

She addresses the idea that the app allows trolls to target people "at their most vulnerable," a concern raised by a number of Twitter users, also quoted in the article. Her response, unfortunately, was unsatisfying:

> ...but these are tweets that are public anyway, and if someone did want to use Radar and Twitter in this way, then they would be able to do that without the use of Radar. I think what's interesting as well is this also highlights wider issues about privacy in the online environment more generally, and we'd urge people to, kind of, think about this a little bit when they are tweeting and be mindful of who their followers are when they're putting messages out into the public sphere, especially if they're feeling vulnerable.

Again, the Daily Dot article responds to the problem as it applies to those in mental distress quite well:

> During many Twitter storms, people under attack have been told to make their accounts private to avoid unwanted attention, but this puts the impetus in the wrong place. For many Twitter users, locking their accounts further isolates them and limits the number of people they can contact; ironically, for people with mental health conditions, isolation is the last thing one needs.

What's interesting to me, though, is that point of view doesn't even work for normal people. While we all have some sense that everything they're saying is "public," most people aren't actually broadcasting to 250 million people every time they send a tweet. You typically have a much smaller subset of that audience which you're actualyl talking to an interacting with on a regular basis. What you write is accessible to everyone, but you're not writing *for* everyone.

Just like a blog or a magazine is public, writing on social in written with a particular audience in mind: friends, family, members of a shared community, whatever. You're not writing for "public," and if you're going to do something in social, or on the internet more generally, that mismatches the expected size and quality of the intended audience with your particular audience, you're going to cause problems, especially when you do that to a "community of care."[^2]

Interestingly, I think this parallels quite a bit with Gawker's [Twitter is Public][2] charade. The group of people involved in the discussion around sexual assault on Twitter that sparked the whole discussion can be described similarly as a "community of care,"[^3] and a mistake was made in mismatching the expected audience of, yes, a *large* group of people, who are taking care of each other by sharing with one another, with the wider internet audience.

I'll admit, I was 

[^1]: Granted, I probably don't use them the same way others do, but at least understanding how the networks function on a mechanical level is important.

[^2]: I include this caveat in particular because I'm not arguing that intellectual discussions across communities can't or shouldn't take place, but that special attention should be paid to what you're doing when you're dealing individuals and groups who are vulnerable.

[^3]: I'm leaving out the other, fraught problem with the appropriation of black labor in producing the Buzzfeed article, partially because I don't know enough to say anything useful about it, and partially because I was pretty wrong on this issue during the event itself. I don't mean to dismiss that aspect of the issue, hence this footnote, but I do want to leave it to others to discuss.
